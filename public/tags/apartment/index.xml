      <description>My name is Simy and I live in the centre of Belgrade in an apartment just off Knez Mihailova. I came to Belgrade as my son is studying at the University of Belgrade, Faculty of Medicine and when he joined he was only 16 years old and as a minor had to be accompanied by an adult. So I quit my job and came to stay with him. I used to be Head of Customer Services for a multinational company in Dubai however when I moved to Belgrade I could not get any jobs and so I took to organizing Supper clubs and freelance as an Indian Food Consultant.</description>
