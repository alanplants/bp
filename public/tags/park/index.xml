      <description>Hyde park (Senjak, Topcider) is my place of choice for a relaxing walk after work and during the weekend. It feels like an emotional reset to spend time in a quiet green space after a day in the office. The time I spend there is directly proportional to my good mood. I feel happy to be a part of nature and I feel reinvigorated after some exercise. Other people occupying the place are mostly locals taking their dogs out for a walk or their kids to the little playground in the park.</description>

      <description>Nine months ago, I relocated to Belgrade and moved into an apartment near Vukov Spomenik. I soon found the best way to walk to the city centre was through Tašmajdan, an urban park with paved walkways surrounded by lawns and a few trees. A couple of months later, I was really missing walking through woodland areas and began looking on maps to find one nearby. It was then that I discovered a wood not far from my apartment called Park-šuma Zvezdara.</description>
