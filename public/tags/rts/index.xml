      <description>When we think of a war memorial or monument, we tend to picture bold statements in very public places â€“ monumental arches, columns topped with statues celebrating victory: soldiers standing with bowed heads, minimalist engraved steles, a flame, perhaps, indicating loss or deep solemnity.

Many are mighty, massive, stylized abstract structures, standing alone or set in cultured green spaces, imposing themselves on all that surrounds them and all who approach them.</description>
