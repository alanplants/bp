                    <p>For me it’s a big irony to stay in (self-)isolation behind one of the most playful wall decorations in Belgrade. On a brighter note, seeing people playing music and dancing together, even though it’s nothing more than an engraving on the wall, fills me with hope every time I enter the building.</p>

<p>We (my husband and I) have lived in this flat for six months now and although convenience was the first reason for us in choosing this neighbourhood and this building, I feel that I’m becoming more and more attached to both. Having to spend a lot of time indoors has certainly its share in this growing attachment, but the layout of the flat and its connection to the heart of the city are actually the main reasons.</p>

<p>One of the best things about the flat is the constant daylight it gets. I can practically follow the sun from one window to another, from early in the morning till very late in the afternoon. It’s a bit silly but it makes me feel like a sunflower, especially now, when the winter is over and we just started to enjoy the sun. I’m not sure I’ll feel the same in summer but I hope we won’t have to spend that much time indoors when summer comes.</p>

<p>Another aspect of the layout I like the most are the connections between rooms. There are three main rooms which are all connected and this allows for a more flexible use of space, especially now, when we are spending almost all of our time at home. I guess we’ve just been lucky because we were thinking that the flat was too big for us since the first day we started to live here. But now, it turned out to be the perfect place to spend such weird times.</p>

<p>I’ve never liked owning too much stuff, both in terms of furniture and personal items. Here too, my personal contribution to the decoration of the flat or to household items is minimal. The only exception is houseplants. I try to have a few houseplants wherever I go because for me, they are a constant reminder of having roots while being able to change places.</p>

<p>In terms of the flat’s connection to the life outside, there are minor yet significant details which I came to understand only with the change in the outside environment.
I’ve always paid attention and liked to hear regular noises coming from the street. Although our street is not a very busy one, there were always (almost 24 hours a day) some specific noises coming from the pubs around, from the people passing by, from the trucks cleaning the street and so on. Now, when I open the window within the curfew hours, all I can hear is the beeping sound of traffic lights, which are not very close anyway. It feels like a place equivalent of an out of body experience. It’s like being in a place which feels extremely familiar yet unknown at the same time.</p>

<p>I can see a neighbourhood pub from my kitchen window. Before it was closed because of the current situation, it was always full of people and I liked to see people gathering there, enjoying the small slices of sun they can get between the buildings. Now, when I look that way, no matter what time of the day, I instinctively think “Is it too early? Why is this pub so empty?”. Then I come back to reality, and open my own beer while waiting for the pub to be filled with people once again.
Till then, I’m trying to enjoy all that I have, looking at this beautiful and peaceful inner yard.</p>
