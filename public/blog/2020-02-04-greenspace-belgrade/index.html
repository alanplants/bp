                    <p>One of the many appealing features of Belgrade from this outsiders point of view, are the scruffy patches of land that occupy the spaces in between a spectrum of contemporary and post war developments. The forgotten places, unkempt playgrounds, graffiti inscribed spaces left over after planning (sloap), abandoned and unknown facilities etc. In some places this pervading cultural anomaly has been offset by creative enterprises, on the face of it their shelf lives appear limited. Will they still be running in the months and years to come? It’s possible and likely probable; they’ll eventually be carved out of the cultural landscape by profit driven developers through well-worn gentrification processes. Maybe they’ll evolve into something more established, but are currently at the mercy of shifts in social trends.
Many of these forgotten spaces are the urban landscape equivalent of the gravely ill patient sat in an overcrowded hospital patiently waiting for a Warfarin prescription. In reality what is needed is a defibrillator and triple heart bypass surgery and the pharmacy only stocks aspirin anyway.<br />
So what can be done? How can these spaces become something more than the landscapes of neglect?</p>

<p>The emotional, cultural and social well being of urban communities is dependent on numerous considerations and factors. The establishment of a sense of place and the role of ecology in achieving this is a primary element in the objective of environmental sustainability. However, getting built environment professionals to think beyond their default notions and procedures can be challenging.
The creation of the urban landscape is a cross-disciplinary venture, defined by the contribution of architects, designers and urban designers/planners. Modernism and postmodernist sensibilities have ostensibly determined the designed characteristics of towns and cities, but the reliance on these methods has arguably run its course. The rationale for a more progressive approach to the development of urban landscapes is an important consideration when advancing design concepts and implementation strategies.</p>

<p>One such alternative model is the ‘landscape urbanism’ agenda. This is founded in the recognition that the landscape can act as a model for urbanism. Some architects, designers, urban planners and designers are beginning to move to a shared form of hybrid practice where the landscape is a formative element. This represents a departure from the traditional view of the landscape being separate to the city. A more pragmatic approach to design strategies could be formulated through existing knowledge and the willingness to apply community based design solutions. This could be as simple as rethinking the nature of place in small patches of urban space within what the urban designer Alan Berger describes as ‘drosscape’. Berger attaches no value system to these post-industrial spaces; they are neither bad nor good, but in need of new conceptualisation. Similarly, Michael Hough in his seminal book ‘Cities and Natural Processes’ challenges the conventional aesthetics of the formal designed application of urban ecologies. He argues that the landscapes of nature, with their origins in poverty and necessity hold significant lessons in the pursuit of a more sustainable urban form. He acknowledges the validity of the vernacular landscapes of forgotten places, rooftops, pavements or wherever a foothold can be gained. This natural processes driven ecological approach to designed urban green spaces runs counter to the established designed landscape of mown turf and regimented planting, but ultimately frames the dilemma in establishing a ‘new’ design philosophy. The challenge for built environment professions is to channel existing knowledge structures in creating a radical renegotiation of what a place means within such spaces. A more ecologically inspired urban form can be seen as an antidote to the standardised blandness of many new developments, a more breathable, energy efficient and aesthetically gratifying vision of the city.</p>

<p>There is no doubt that the more green areas there are in a city, the better the air quality and ambient temperatures. In Belgrade the consistently poor air quality standards should be reason enough to shunt agencies into taking action. However, the associated economic and political problems associated with reducing vehicle emissions and energy production, will not be resolved anytime soon. Nevertheless, there are baby steps that could be taken, in shifting the way we think of the spaces that directly surround us. By taking these steps, communities could begin to create more breathable spaces that are fit for purpose. For example, planting roadside plants can lower CO2 emissions and lower temperatures by 5%. Green roofs and their vertical partner – the living wall, improve indoor air quality by removing toxic chemicals and carbon dioxide and insulate against summer heat and winter cold. Western societies are living their lives further away from nature and the Serbian population is no different. Green spaces within cities boost health by restoring mental fatigue, how we perceive the surrounding environment through our senses can appreciably affect human health.</p>

<p>Whilst it would be simple minded to suggest that making such approaches a reality is easy, there are plenty of examples of creative initiatives to be inspired by. The guerrilla gardening movement for example, is the act of gardening patches of urban spaces not owned by the people doing the planting. As a concept it is driven by the need for direct action to benefit local communities. The northern English town of Todmorden is the birthplace of another direct action scheme – Incredible Edible. At its heart is a simple idea, that being, to take over what Berger or Hough might describe as forgotten landscapes and grow vegetables for the community. This model has now been adopted across the globe in places from as far as Israel and Palestine to Columbia and Brazil. This bottom up approach grabs the attention of policy makers and financial stakeholders and can make a difference.</p>

<p>There are more and more examples, of governmental agencies waking up to the need to be more proactive and innovative in their approach in dealing with environmental preservation. The American state of Minnesota has recently allocated nearly a million dollars of incentives to transform lawns into bee-friendly native grasses, clover and wildflowers. The aim is to provide food sources for all kinds of pollinators, the loss of woodland in the region made bees more dependent on urban lawn flowers. Urban dwellers are eligible for grants between, $350 - $500 to sow clover seeds. The clover spreads like weeds and can be interspersed with flowers such as creeping thyme, ground plumb and dandelions. Is it unimaginable that similar schemes could flourish in Belgrade?</p>

<p>There is no complex formula needed to make spaces greener and beneficial to local communities, it’s a question of scale. Projects such as the High Line in NYC have focussed on the regeneration of dilapidated city infrastructure, but considerable investment is needed for landmarks projects such as these. Whilst community driven programmes are to a degree constrained by funding limitations, they create communal participation, the first step to grass roots activism. There is considerable empirical evidence to suggest that bottom up environmentalism can be an effective method of nudging decision makers to be more environmentally progressive. If there’s a will to make Belgrade’s ecological foot print a little less toxic, then get out your shovels and start planting.</p>
