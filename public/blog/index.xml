      <title>My Place, Hyde Park</title>

      <description>Hyde park (Senjak, Topcider) is my place of choice for a relaxing walk after work and during the weekend. It feels like an emotional reset to spend time in a quiet green space after a day in the office. The time I spend there is directly proportional to my good mood. I feel happy to be a part of nature and I feel reinvigorated after some exercise. Other people occupying the place are mostly locals taking their dogs out for a walk or their kids to the little playground in the park.</description>

      <title>My Place, Park-šuma Zvezdara</title>

      <description>Nine months ago, I relocated to Belgrade and moved into an apartment near Vukov Spomenik. I soon found the best way to walk to the city centre was through Tašmajdan, an urban park with paved walkways surrounded by lawns and a few trees. A couple of months later, I was really missing walking through woodland areas and began looking on maps to find one nearby. It was then that I discovered a wood not far from my apartment called Park-šuma Zvezdara.</description>

      <title>A Place For All</title>

      <description>Tasmadjan is a park catering for all. It’s well located just out of town between the parliament and Vukov Spomenik. It has something for all seasons. A jogging path and workout area, cafes, paths, dog zones, kids’ zones, a stadium at the back and a church for when you feel spiritual. There are green lawns with trees throughout, some large and generous offering shade in summer. Apparently, it used to be a graveyard and has quite a history.</description>

      <description>When we think of a war memorial or monument, we tend to picture bold statements in very public places – monumental arches, columns topped with statues celebrating victory: soldiers standing with bowed heads, minimalist engraved steles, a flame, perhaps, indicating loss or deep solemnity. Former Yugoslavia is scattered with its own unique spomeniks born out of the Second World War. Many are mighty, massive, stylized abstract structures, standing alone or set in cultured green spaces, imposing themselves on all that surrounds them and all who approach them.</description>

      <title>My place - urban but not</title>

      <description>I am picking the forest for my place in the city. It isn’t right in the city, but in walking distance from my house and you can easily take a bus there.
I like it because it is close and a world away from the city. It makes me feel relaxed and happy and it’s the best place to observe the major differences between the seasons. There are a lot of “places” in the forest.</description>

      <title>The Potential of Neglected Spaces</title>

      <description>One of the many appealing features of Belgrade from this outsiders point of view, are the scruffy patches of land that occupy the spaces in between a spectrum of contemporary and post war developments. The forgotten places, unkempt playgrounds, graffiti inscribed spaces left over after planning (sloap), abandoned and unknown facilities etc. In some places this pervading cultural anomaly has been offset by creative enterprises, on the face of it their shelf lives appear limited.</description>

      <title>My place, Car park, Cetinska</title>

      <description>On the face of it ‘my’ place doesn’t reflect typical assumptions, if such things exist, of what restful environments look like. I take it as a given that car parks do not feature in most people’s preferences when considering where to kick back. Nevertheless, ‘my place’ is a car park, or more accurately a car park that forms the space in which an eclectic assemblage of buildings and structures form a patchwork perimeter of businesses, bars and restaurants.</description>

      <title>My place, Tas</title>

      <description>Barely five minutes’ stroll from home, Tasmajdan is a modest park, but that seems fitting considering the scale of the city. It’s dominated at one end by Sveti Marko Crkve. Although constructed relatively recently, its architecture is based on the 14th century Gracanica Monastery in Kosovo, lending it majesty and gravitas. As the park stretches away, it is filled with towering aged trees beneath which lie children’s playgrounds, fountains, statues and sculptures, all connected by a network of paths.</description>

      <description>When asked to write about ‘my place’ I knew immediately what to write about. It is the faculty of philosophy. Tree of life. Six levels up. We are all breathing together, joined by an idea so porous and idealistic but strong at its root. I say &amp;ldquo;we&amp;rdquo; because I am also a former student of this faculty, majoring in ethnology - anthropology. Although I graduated from college long ago, I always go back to it.</description>

      <title>Kursulina Street </title>

      <description>The place that is closest to my heart in Belgrade is Kursulina street on Vracar. It is located behind the Sveti Sava temple and leads to Kaleniceva market. There are only a few cafes there; it is mostly old communist residential buildings on both sides. However, those buildings seem to have been a bit more luxurious than the other communist buildings that can be seen in this city, as if teachers, lawyers and doctors populated them.</description>

      <description>Living far away from home, family and friends makes me need a place where I can breath and find peace of mind. My place is a place, feeling and a necessity for me. The place is the quay along the river Danube, more specifically the end of the man made quay in Zemun. Zemun Kej is my paradise when walking there with my dogs early in the morning. I always meet the same few existences; the men who are standing on the brink with fishing poles trying to catch a fish or two, the stray cats watching the men begging for them to give them their smallest catch, the very cheerful lady who feeds the many swans with leftover bread from nearby restaurants.</description>
