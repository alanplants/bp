                    <p>My name is Simy and I live in the centre of Belgrade in an apartment just off Knez Mihailova.
I came to Belgrade as my son is studying at the University of Belgrade, Faculty of Medicine and when he joined he was only 16 years old and as a minor had to be accompanied by an adult. So I quit my job and came to stay with him. I used to be Head of Customer Services for a multinational company in Dubai however when I moved to Belgrade I could not get any jobs and so I took to organizing Supper clubs and freelance as an Indian Food Consultant.</p>

<p>I chose to live in this apartment for one main reason and that was because it had cooking gas as opposed to an electric cooker. I am someone that loves to cook a lot and having an electric cooker was an absolute nightmare in terms of the amount of time it took me to cook, particularly my kind of elaborate cooking. Also, the location of the apartment, which is right in the heart of the city off the main high street.
I prefer minimalist aesthetics and absolutely dislike clutter. I like minimal but definitely warm tones and wooden items of furniture. I also feel that a space filled ‘with things’ is high maintenance in terms of keeping it clean. The fewer items in a living space the easier it is to keep it neat, tidy and dust free. As such, I prefer tiles to wooden floors, however the current apartment has wooden flooring and I just do not like it. It’s Creaky for one and maintenance as in making sure wet cleaning is limited as water seeps in etc.
Unfortunately, the apartment came fully furnished so I have had no input in the colors, furniture or layout of the place. I have added some things to remind us of family like photographs and scented candles. I also try growing herbs in my balcony when weather permits.</p>

<p>The layout of the apartment is important to me and I was pleased that it was an open layout and not closed. Also, the apartment has lots of natural light as it faces an open space. In my opinion, the space one lives in definitely impacts one’s mood. A well-lit, open home definitely is a mood lifter. Particularly natural light is something that certainly makes me happy.
From my window I can see a park, parents and children playing, a café where people sit and chill over a cup of coffee, beer and food too. Coffee and conversations galore along with some great music the café plays.</p>

<p>My kitchen is where I feel relaxed because this is where I trial recipes and cooking makes me happiest. My kitchen is an open space and looks out on to the balcony so when I cook I keep the balcony door open and it’s nice to hear the birds when I cook. I am not working currently so yes a lot of time is spent at home.
The object I feel most connected to is the gas stove and after that my spice cabinet (yes I am strange like that – whoever likes their gas stove!). That’s because the gas stove is where I stand the most and watch my recipes come to life. Living away from home and family is hard and cooking my traditional food makes me feel closer to home and my family.</p>
