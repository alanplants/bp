As such we welcome contributions from anyone wishing to play a part in making urban environments more liveable or would simply like to share their thoughts and observations on the subject. The Beoplace concept was devised by <b>Alan Derbyshire</b> as a means of delivering a more accessible model of discourse and analysis. After many years working in academia, researching and delivering built environment related programmes, he was inspired to create a forum that was a more immediate mechanism for sharing ideas and research, rather than standard academic journal publishing."
