Barely five minutes’ stroll from home, Tasmajdan is a modest park, but that seems fitting considering the scale of the city. It’s dominated at one end by Sveti Marko Crkve. Although constructed relatively recently, its architecture is based on the 14th century Gracanica Monastery in Kosovo, lending it majesty and gravitas. As the park stretches away, it is filled with towering aged trees beneath which lie children’s playgrounds, fountains, statues and sculptures, all connected by a network of paths. Early morning sees the park welcome sporadic dog walkers and joggers. Despite the busy Bulevar running alongside it, it is the natural beauty of the trees and shrubbery that dominates the senses. I prefer to visit in the quiet of early morning in summer and evening in winter, especially if snow has fallen. 

Although in the heart of the city, it offers a place of solitude and soulful recuperation. As the day picks up, so does the human traffic: young mums and push chairs, courting couples, those on the move to and from the heart of the city. Enough to bring the park live, but never too many to overwhelm it. And me. Sometimes carrying my camera, sometimes merely taking the air, sometimes on an errand, sometimes just flirting with the edges, taking in the sights and sounds and smells a park can often miraculously offer midst the pollution of urban existence. Whenever I visit, for whatever reason, I invariably depart refreshed.
