Living far away from home, family and friends makes me need a place where I can breath and find peace of mind. 

My place is a place, feeling and a necessity for me. The place is the quay along the river Danube, more specifically the end of the man made quay in Zemun. 

Zemun Kej is my paradise when walking there with my dogs early in the morning. 
I always meet the same few existences; the men who are standing on the brink with fishing poles trying to catch a fish or two, the stray cats watching the men begging for them to give them their smallest catch, the very cheerful lady who feeds the many swans with leftover bread from nearby restaurants. The enthusiastic amateur photographer who tries to capture all the beauty the sunrise is throwing at us. 

My place has a picturesque charm - glancing at the slow flowing and lazy river only stirred up by long and even slower tugboats. Looking at the hills behind Belgrade in the distance and the last lights still on in the old city. 

Walking past the many restaurants in pretty houses thinking about all the people who meet with friends, business colleagues or couples on dates with expectations that they might have found the love of their life. The feeling of being alone but still surrounded by plenty of life gives me a promises of a wonderful day to come. 

My place might not be the most beautiful or the greenest cleanest place but it’s my sanctuary and my escape.
