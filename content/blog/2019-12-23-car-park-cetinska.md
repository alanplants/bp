On the face of it ‘my’ place doesn’t reflect typical assumptions, if such things exist, of what restful environments look like. I take it as a given that car parks do not feature in most people’s preferences when considering where to kick back. Nevertheless, ‘my place’ is a car park, or more accurately a car park that forms the space in which an eclectic assemblage of buildings and structures form a patchwork perimeter of businesses, bars and restaurants.  

This place is situated on Cetinska, about one hundred metres North of the intersection with Bulevard despota Stefana. You are greeted at the gated entrance of the car park by a car wash, but that’s where thoughts of soulless parking spaces end. This place just happens to house cars, the humdrum entranceway acts as confirmation to any prospective visitor that this space is a functioning necessity, nothing more nothing less, nothing to see here folks. For this reason alone I’d love this place, there are no seductive prompts or discernable indication of what exists beyond the automated barriers. It’s a car park, isn’t it?

Well yes and no, there are painted lines in which to manoeuvre and leave a car, but this detail is incidental to the artefacts that litter the space. A mural of Etta James surveys the parking practices of the transient occupants encountering the eclectic jumble of buildings, colour and materials. Juxtaposing assemblages of exposed brick, peeling paint and DIY fencing (to name just a few elements), contrive to bring about a complementary blend of form and visual metaphor. The ascendancy of creativity over subjugation or shifting cultural identities in the global village, take your pick or make up your own. This space is not the place of pleasing aesthetics in the traditional sense, having said that, this rich tapestry of texture, colour and form collaborate to draw out a no less appealing unintended visual effect. 

To my mind, this space symbolises the organic development of many of the spaces turned places that have emerged in Belgrade. A germinating hybrid of creativity, resourcefulness and chance, in much the same way that the pre-gentrified neighbourhoods of New York’s lower East side or Manchester’s Northern Quarter were fashioned on shoestring budgets and can do attitude. 
Perhaps my attachment to ‘my place’ is rooted in nostalgia, my salad days in New York City, the sharing of ideas and energy associated with realising an objective. Maybe I just enjoy sitting with a beer watching life come and go in an idiosyncratic setting, I’ll take either.
