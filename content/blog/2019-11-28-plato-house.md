When asked to write about ‘my place’ I knew immediately what to write about. It is the faculty of philosophy. Tree of life. Six levels up. We are all breathing together, joined by an idea so porous and idealistic but strong at its root. I say "we" because I am also a former student of this faculty, majoring in ethnology - anthropology.
Although I graduated from college long ago, I always go back to it. Big plato in front of the faculty is ordinarily a meeting spot, a place where I meet with friends. That is because I am always looking for a reason to be around it, there I feel at home, free and footloose I raise my legs on the bench then cross them (turski sed) and wait. I go there for my busineses too and work on my projects there. I still use my ethnological library on the fifth floor from which I take books. I spend all day like that. Sometimes I feel like I no longer belong there. 
Feelings of nonbelonging, however, gradually fade out because you witness certain occurencies. It seems that nothing is going on, but if you look closer and deeper, you may notice all kinds of wonders taking place in this corner of the earth. 
That is when I notice over and over again a certain phenomena. It is the phenomena of the ghosts of the university. It feels little weird when I run into them. Namely, they are faces without names, at least known to me, immortal shadows who walk the corridors of the Faculty of Philosophy forever and ever. They are always there and they always look the same. They are not getting old and they smille. I have no idea why they accompany me and it irritates me. Do they come with some purpose or they just like to hang around there? They may feel that they are part of something here. Maybe the enviromnement helps them to be who they are. I will stop making assumptions, failing to truly figure out the vampire depictions of the philosophical university, and it might not be a good idea to dig deep into it after all.

When looking ahead, this place appears to vibrate. Plato in front of the faculty, entrance, elevators, corridors, student toilets and, oh yes, the professor's toilets. Floors separated by spacial forms and materials, giving structure to the time and experiences created by generations of additions and subtractions. Each floor is different, the Faculty of Philosophy is divided into psychology students and all others. The first group mesmerises, but everyone else appears to be a fusion of thrash-emo breakup and dischordant harmony, bonded by an uneasy self-awareness that will never be resolved. The first group are an alien species from an unknown distant galaxy orbiting and behaving differently, the vast majority being trendy girls, while the second group is made up of dangerously authentic individuals. It is they, the special, the ironic, the sarcastic, the suspicious, the deathly inclined to the intellectual debates in which one must “die”, who form the core and soul of this place. That is, among many other reasons, why this is the place where ideas and profound principles occur and always will be worth fighting for. 

Having said that, the Faculty of Philosophy is where revolutions always began. This rebellious spirit does not sleep but rather relentlessly permeates the air and growls behind every corner. Subversive generations, as if by some unwritten agreement repeatedly apply to be students of the university. Maybe it's a conspiracy propagated by some sacred society, like a Freemason, secretly organizing and implementing beliefs. How exactly do these characters identifiable by their long coats, paradoxically careless and ordered, enroll in college over and over again? They’re clones of my friends- Milutin, Sladja, Bokelj, Grdinic, Matija, Jelenica, in a different forms, but with the same lunatic look in their eyes.
Ahead of the philosophical are the same history students who’s knowledge extends to discussing the previous lecture. Generations of history students scheduled to argue after every class. They are the craziest. Namely, for them the lecture has never stopped. It has neither begun, nor will it ever begin, let alone stop. So how can all those historical conventions be called into question in such a short time? These are people who learn foreign languages to read literature in those languages so they can gain an insight into another historical point of view that interests them. Nerds dying for their stands while nervously walking from end to of the corridor of the half-lit fifth floor. There is always a condescending, thin girl who keeps her mouth shut with them, later you see that same girl giving classes and you begin question your assumptions.

The Faculty of philosophy is intense, it lives, it craves, it screams, it bites, it loves, it evokes emotions, it draws you into itself, you need to be a part of this life to se all that I see. But even without my viewpoint this story can make one think of its colors, stories, laughter, sadness, beauty, everything that can’t ever be expected.
