When we think of a war memorial or monument, we tend to picture bold statements in very public places – monumental arches, columns topped with statues celebrating victory: soldiers standing with bowed heads, minimalist engraved steles, a flame, perhaps, indicating loss or deep solemnity. Former Yugoslavia is scattered with its own unique spomeniks born out of the Second World War. Many are mighty, massive, stylized abstract structures, standing alone or set in cultured green spaces, imposing themselves on all that surrounds them and all who approach them. 

Tucked away off Takovska, hidden by the surrounding buildings, stands the RTS building, destroyed by a cruise missile during the NATO bombardment of Serbia in 1999. It stands as a monument to the 16 staff who lost their lives in the attack, all civilians. One complete wall has collapsed, seemingly peeled away to reveal the building’s inner structure, like a Victorian dolls’ house. The remaining walls form a shell. It appears little-changed from the aftermath of its bombing, save the random rusting metal poles, inserted to support ceilings. There are apparent anomalies – each floor is still intact, no gaping holes, windows appear to have been sucked open inwards rather than blown outwards. 

It reminds me, oddly and intangibly, of Tracy Emin’s unmade bed installation. I struggle to fathom why. Perhaps both satisfy a fascination with the beauty to be found in disorder, in detritus and dirt. Not the seemly substance of art or war memorials, most would consider.
It has been standing there like that for 20 years or so now. People pass it without a second glance.  Plans can be found at the foot of the building for renovation and the construction of a museum. These have faded as the years have passed. Is this because of a lack of money, a lack of resolve (out of sight, out of mind), or has it been decided that simply leaving it as it stands offers the most fitting memorial? It does not thrust itself on the viewer as the mighty contrived spomeniks do; it has been absorbed into its surroundings, almost to a state of invisibility. It has the feel of privacy and intimacy – a modest memorial, not to be wondered at, marveled at, more a place for reflection. It’s there if you want to go and seek it out. 
In my eyes, it has an air of solemnity, of respect and remembrance. It suggests defiance. And it possesses beauty.
