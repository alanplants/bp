Nine months ago, I relocated to Belgrade and moved into an apartment near Vukov Spomenik. I soon found the best way to walk to the city centre was through Tašmajdan, an urban park with paved walkways surrounded by lawns and a few trees. 
A couple of months later, I was really missing walking through woodland areas and began looking on maps to find one nearby. It was then that I discovered a wood not far from my apartment called Park-šuma Zvezdara. None of my ex-pat friends had ever been there or knew what it was like, so I set off to explore.
Half an hour later I arrived and found myself walking along narrow tracks in dense woodland. It was so scenic, and as the seasons were transitioning, many of the leaves were changing from bright green to amber tones. I was serenaded by the sound of birds, which are strangely absent in most parts of the city; and by the end of my walk in nature, I felt refreshed, revitalised and inspired – it was just what I needed to help me survive life in an urban jungle. 
I expected a park so close to the city and as beautiful as this one to be surrounded by mansions or expensive houses. The upmarket houses that back onto Richmond Park in London are worth millions, but the houses surrounding this park were mostly rundown and some even appeared abandoned! 

From the top of the hill, in the northern section of the park, there are some views of the River Danube, but I prefer walking lower down in the dense woodland where I can continually get lost and find my way again. I’ll often take a notepad and pen with me to do some creative writing at one of the picnic tables spread around the park.
This area remains a natural haven as there are no shops or commercial businesses inside the park; although on the outskirts, there are a couple of restaurants, a small football ground, and a science and technology centre. I also expected the park to be quite crowded but was pleasantly surprised to find only a few dog walkers and the occasional jogger.
Most of the trees in the park are deciduous, so there is plenty of shade in the hot summertime, and when most of the leaves have fallen, the rays of the warming winter sun permeate into the heart of the woodland. And another benefit is that when the city centre is covered in a cloud of smog of more than 200 on the Air Quality Index scale, there’s no need to take an air pollution mask to Zvezdara because it is always in the ‘green’ zone at around 20!

Since working out which buses run to the park or close by, I can get there quicker and spend more time in the park and less walking along the busy roads leading to it. So, these days, I go walking through the woods several times a week, and if I haven’t been there for more than about three days, I begin to experience withdrawal symptoms.
Sutton Park in Birmingham, one of the largest urban parks in Europe, is where I spent much of my childhood exploring the woods, so it’s no wonder I find Park-šuma Zvezdara such a magnetic and peaceful retreat.
