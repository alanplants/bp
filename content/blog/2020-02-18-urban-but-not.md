I am picking the forest for my place in the city. It isn’t right in the city, but in walking distance from my house and you can easily take a bus there.

I like it because it is close and a world away from the city. It makes me feel relaxed and happy and it’s the best place to observe the major differences between the seasons. There are a lot of “places” in the forest. I like the path between my house and the exercise track. There are benches if you just want to sit and soak up the sun. It is a pretty popular area, so it’s good for people watching and observing the happy dogs lucky enough to be out for a walk. I especially like watching for mushrooms and other fungus growing out of the dead trees and branches scattered around. 

It is a good place to zone out. You can enjoy the quiet or listen to music or a podcast and you can pay as much or as little attention to your surroundings as the mood you’re in. If you’re with people, especially kids, there are a few playgrounds, cafes, and you can usually find a bathroom for the emergencies with the kids! 

The track has fitness stations and a big field in the middle. I find it relaxing to walk around there, listen to a book and not pay too much attention to anything else. 

The environment is natural, but improved with amenities and is maintained. My happy place will always be in nature or have natural elements.
